	Continuous Integration/CDelivery/CDeployment :::
	
Process/Steps to be follow ::::

	1. Gathering Info. & Cust. Requirements
	2. Developer plan & develop the src code
	3. publish the src code to github repo
	4. Devops CI/CD Pipeline starts
	5. automate build and deployment
	
How to implement these process/steps??

	1. Infra-Structure Setup/Configuration :::
	
		Requirements ???
		
		What are the environments needed?
		How many Servers needed?
		What are the tools will be installed in each server?
		How the servers are connected?
		And the Servers dependencies and workflow.
		
	2. Application Development :::
		Create Application Project using Eclipse.
			Make some update in the project
	
	3. CI/CD - Pipeline to be created to perform automated build/deploy
	
	4. Monitoring 
	


	1. Infra-Structure Setup/Configuration :::
	
		Requirements ???
		
		What are the environments needed?
			DEV
			QA 
			PROD
		
		How many Servers needed?
			Dev Machine - (local windows Machine)
			Jenkin_Master - (create jenkins jobs/scheduling) 
			Jenkin_Slave  - (Perform Build and create artifacts 
			
		What are the tools will be installed in each server?
			DEV :
				Local Machine :::
					Tools ::: 	JDK, Eclipse, Tomcat, GIT,
								Visual Studio Code, Terraform
								
			
			
		
		What are the tools will be installed in each server?
		How the servers are connected?
		And the Servers dependencies and workflow.
